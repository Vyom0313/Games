So, the flow of the program is 
1. creating a window
2. creating the main function
3. create a title
4. creating a function to draw window

// soooooo, since the draw window function is in the infinite loop, it's being called hundreds or thousands of times based on the speed of the machine so in order to control that we need to set FPS

5. creating objects to import images and drawing them using draw_window

//pygame coordinate system draws a surface from top-left

6. moving the spaceships around using WASD and arrow keys
7. border to divide the screen
8. Now we need to make it so we can't cross the border or go off the screen
9. Now we deal with the creation and firing of bullets
10. Moving the bullets and making the hit the characters
11. Drawing the bullets in draw_window function
12. Giving health
13. Drawing the score
14. Updating the main function
